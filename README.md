-------------- Hello Welcome to my D&D Character Generator --------------

    The console app asks for a name for your Character and a Class
it then rolls stats for your character prints them and allows
you to enter commands to roll different types of dice show a 
graph of your stats and level up your character or exit the program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The features I chose to include are:

- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can
 repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to 
 exit the program.

- Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure 
(such as a list or array) or file.

- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation
 of data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I wrote unit tests but I could not get VS Code to cooperate with them.
My powerstrip exploded and fried my pc with less than a month left to finish
it put me way behind. I'm going to continue to work on it. I hope to add the 
unit tests and a couple of other things before the end of the week.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future I plan to add an api (https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) along with
the ability to cast spells and make attacks pulled from the api.
